## üì¢ Anti-Dowry Awareness

### Legal Information

The **Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976** of Pakistan strictly regulates dowry practices:

- **Section 3**: The total value of dowry and presents shall not exceed five thousand rupees.
- **Section 6**: No person shall give or allow to be given to the bride or bridegroom or to their parents any presents exceeding the value of rupees one thousand.
- **Section 9**: Whoever contravenes the provisions of this Act shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.

Additionally, the **Punjab Marriage Functions Act 2016** prohibits excessive dowry demands and display.

### Islamic Perspective

Islam encourages simplicity in marriages and discourages financial burdens:

- Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: "The best of marriages are those that are easiest." (Abu Dawood)
- The Prophet (PBUH) also said: "The most blessed nikah is the one with the least expenses." (Al-Bayhaqi)
- In Islam, Mahr (dower) is given by the husband to the wife as a gift, not the other way around. The concept of dowry (jahez) from the bride's family is a cultural practice, not an Islamic requirement.
