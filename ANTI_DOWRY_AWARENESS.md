# Anti-Dowry Awareness Campaign

## The Problem of Dowry in Pakistan

Dowry is a cultural practice in which the bride's family provides goods, money, or estate to the groom and his family as a condition of marriage. Despite being illegal, the practice of dowry remains prevalent in Pakistan and continues to cause significant social and economic problems:

- **Financial Burden**: Families often go into debt to provide dowry for their daughters
- **Delayed Marriages**: Inability to afford dowry can delay marriages indefinitely
- **Domestic Violence**: Disputes over "insufficient dowry" often lead to domestic violence
- **Social Pressure**: Families face immense social pressure to provide substantial dowry
- **Gender Discrimination**: The practice reinforces the perception of daughters as financial burdens

## Legal Framework in Pakistan

### Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976

This federal law explicitly restricts dowry practices in Pakistan:

- **Section 3**: The total value of dowry shall not exceed five thousand rupees
- **Section 4**: Requires a list of dowry items to be prepared and signed
- **Section 5**: Prohibits display of dowry items
- **Section 6**: Restricts the value of presents to one thousand rupees
- **Section 9**: Violations are punishable with imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine up to ten thousand rupees

### Punjab Marriage Functions Act, 2016

This provincial law further restricts ostentatious displays and expenses related to marriages:

- Limits the number of dishes that can be served at wedding functions
- Prohibits the display of dowry items
- Restricts excessive decoration and fireworks
- Imposes penalties for violations

### Other Provincial Legislations

Several provinces have enacted similar laws to restrict dowry practices:

- **Sindh**: The Sindh Dowry Act, 2017
- **Khyber Pakhtunkhwa**: The KP Dowry, Bridal Gift and Marriage Functions Restriction Act, 2017

## Islamic Perspective on Dowry

Islam has a clear stance on marriage expenses and dowry:

### Mahr vs. Jahez

- **Mahr**: In Islam, mahr is a mandatory gift from the groom to the bride, which becomes her exclusive property
- **Jahez**: The cultural practice of the bride's family giving gifts to the groom is not an Islamic requirement

### Prophetic Teachings

- The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: "The most blessed nikah is the one with the least expenses." (Al-Bayhaqi)
- He also said: "The best of marriages are those that are easiest." (Abu Dawood)
- The Prophet (PBUH) advised: "Marry even with (a mahr equal to) an iron ring." (Bukhari)

### Islamic Scholars' Views

Contemporary Islamic scholars unanimously agree that:

- Demanding dowry from the bride's family contradicts Islamic principles
- Simplicity in marriage is encouraged
- Financial burden on the bride's family is discouraged

## Harmful Effects of Dowry

### Social Impact

- **Gender Inequality**: Reinforces the perception of women as financial burdens
- **Female Infanticide**: Can lead to preference for male children
- **Delayed Marriages**: Young people remain unmarried due to financial constraints
- **Class Divisions**: Widens the gap between economic classes

### Psychological Impact

- **Mental Stress**: Families experience anxiety and depression over dowry demands
- **Low Self-Esteem**: Women may feel devalued when their worth is measured by dowry
- **Family Conflicts**: Disputes over dowry can strain family relationships

### Economic Impact

- **Financial Strain**: Families exhaust savings or incur debt
- **Resource Misallocation**: Money that could be used for education or healthcare is diverted to dowry
- **Poverty Cycle**: Dowry can perpetuate cycles of poverty

## How to Combat Dowry Practices

### Individual Actions

- Refuse to give or accept dowry
- Educate family members about the legal and religious aspects
- Promote simple marriages
- Report dowry demands to authorities

## Conclusion

Dowry is not only illegal under Pakistani law but also contradicts Islamic teachings. By raising awareness and taking a stand against this practice, we can work towards a society where marriages are based on mutual respect and love rather than financial transactions.
